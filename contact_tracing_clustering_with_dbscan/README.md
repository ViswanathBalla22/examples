# Contact Tracing Clustering with DBSCAN using mlpack

This directory contains machine learning examples focusing on clustering contact tracing data using DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise) with mlpack, a fast, scalable machine learning library.

## Directories
- `cpp`: Contains C++ implementations.

## Files
- `cpp/contact-tracing-dbscan-cpp.ipynb`: Notebook demonstrating contact tracing clustering using DBSCAN with mlpack in C++.

Explore the notebook to learn about implementing DBSCAN for clustering contact tracing data in C++ with mlpack.
